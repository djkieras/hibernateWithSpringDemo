# hibernateWithSpringDemo
This is the sister project for the "hibernateWithoutSpringDemo" to illustrate how much Spring can help
minimize the amount of boilerplate code, and thus allow you to focus on what you need to accomplish.

By no means is this code guaranteed to be production-ready; it is merely a demonstration.  As usual,
with any type of dependency injection tools/frameworks, there may be many more ways to do the same
thing, and possibly better ways.  Additional tools and frameworks always can help, but I wanted to
keep those to a minimum in order to make a clear comparision between using Hibernate both with and
without Spring, all the while using the standard DataSource and EntityManager in a locally managed
connection.
